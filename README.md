### General
Simple app for keeping track of your life totals in Magic the Gathering. You don't always have a pen and paper but you always have your phone. I created this because all the other apps I tried were too busy, had ads or just way to much stuff going on. This is a simplistic life counter, no ads and nothing else. Best of all requires NO Device Permissions!
I plan to add in some new features. Feed back or suggestions please send them to [pieces029@gmail.com](mailto:pieces029@gmail.com "pieces029@gmail.com")
