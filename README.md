# Magic Life Counter [![Google Play](http://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_45.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.nodeath.magichealthcounter)

### General
Simple app for keeping track of your life totals in Magic the Gathering. You don't always have a 
pen and paper but you always have your phone. I created this because all the other apps I tried 
were too busy, had ads or just way to many permission requirements. This is a simplistic life 
counter, no ads, no bs.

Current Features
----------------
- Keep track of 2 players life totals
